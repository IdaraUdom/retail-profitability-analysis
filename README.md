**Project Overview**

This project analyzes profitability drivers within a national discount retail business that operates across online and physical channels. The objective was to understand why the business's strong revenue performance did not translate into consistent profitability and to identify where value was created, eroded, or structurally constrained. 

The project had two phases: an initial executive performance report assessing annual revenue and profitability outcomes, and following an unsatisfactory profit margin performance, a follow-up diagnositc profitability analysis and insights report.

**Business Questions**

Which products and categories generate sustainable profit versus revenue-only growth?

How does discount depth and the discount strategy impact profitability across categories and regions? 

Which regions structurally drive profit or loss?

How does customer value differ when revenue volume is compared with profitability?

Are high-revenue volume customer accounts consistently high profit?

**Analytical methods**

**Scope and Limitations**

The analysis is diagnostic in nature and does not model causal or counterfactual scenarios. Findings are intended to support stakeholders’ strategic discussion and prioritization rather than prescribe operational or pricing decisions.
